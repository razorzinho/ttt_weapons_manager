# This addon consists of a system to manage weapons in the beginning of the rounds on TTT

It also will have functionality to allow specific ranks to choose their specific loadout for every round. The image system must be autonomous, and will not depend on any setting up besides adding the name of the weapon/equipment entity to the global settings (will fetch the image from the entity's properties client-side)

It will have support for client preferences and global configurations for superadmins (by default). All of the global settings will be available in the UI settings - will be properly sepparated from the preferences tab.

The intention is leave it open for collaboration from other developers and creators in the Gmod community, thus, making the code improve as much as possible and maybe grow and have more resources and functionalities.

Another intention we have in mind is to document every important stuff in the code and make it be easily expansible and usable with global functions.

# Another important aspect is the localization

We want to leave it open so anyone can add a new localization table in any other language to the addon
By default, it will support English (UK style) and Portuguese (Brazil)
